Configuration for Server-
Batch files must be configured before use - First line must be manually configured to locate python -C:\Users\hansg\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python39\python.exe- for example the second line must be configured to locate the server code - "C:\Users\hansg\OneDrive - University of Greenwich\Documents\ChatRoom-main\server.py"- for example.
Lastly, you can include the desired IP and ports you wish to start the server on and the server file will be ready for use.
Configuration for Client-
First line is identical to server first line the only difference here is that the second line must be be changed to client.py -"C:\Users\hansg\OneDrive - University of Greenwich\Documents\ChatRoom-main\client.py" -
Original settings will be included to help configure the settings.

Notes: Each run file needs to configured once for permanent use,however, if you wish to change the sever ip and port you can do so through the batch files.


GangChat is a fully configurable portable TCP Server which allows anyone to host the server with simple changes.
